        <h2>1. ATI Technologies</h2>
        <img class="silcon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/ATI-Logo.svg/220px-ATI-Logo.svg.png" alt="">
        <p>ATI Technologies Inc. (ATI, later known as Radeon Technologies Group) was a Canadian semiconductor technology corporation based in Markham, Ontario, that specialized in the development of graphics processing units and chipsets. Founded in 1985 as Array Technology Inc. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquired ATI in 2006. After they got bought out AMD shutdown all manufacturing factories in Canada leaving almost 10,000 Canadians jobless. </p>

        <h2>2. Microsystems International</h2>
        <img class="silcon" src="http://www.cse.yorku.ca/museum/collections/MIL/MIL_LOGO.JPG" alt="">
        <p>Microsystems International Limited (MIL) was a telecommunications microelectronics company based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, founded in 1969. MIL was purchased and folded into Nortel's research arm Bell-Northern Research in 1974. MIL is historically important as the producer of one of the world's earliest microprocessors, the MIL MF7114, which was based on the design of the Intel 4004. MIL also produced a series of early microcomputers using this chip, including the MIL CPS-1. The MIL CPS-1 computer is one of the world's first commercially available microprocessor-based computers. </p>

        <p>For the life of me I could not find a picture of the MIL CPS-1 but here is one of the Altair 8800 a very similar computer made around the same time as the MIL CPS-1 but made by Altair. </p>
        <h2>3. MOSAID</h2>
        <img class="silcon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/MOSAID_logo.jpg/220px-MOSAID_logo.jpg" alt="">
        <p>MOSAID is a semiconductor technology company incorporated in Ottawa, Canada. It was founded in 1975 as a DRAM design company and later branched out into other areas including EDA software, semiconductor reverse engineering, test equipment manufacturing and intellectual property licensing. By 2011 the business was based exclusively on patent licensing and the company was acquired by Sterling Partners, a US-based private equity firm. MOSAID was renamed Conversant Intellectual Property Management in 2013. In 2021, the company announced it was changing its name back to MOSAID. </p>

        <p>Above is a MOSAID 2Mb DRAM chips to put into perspective how small that DRAM size is most modern computers have 8GB of DRAM. </p>
