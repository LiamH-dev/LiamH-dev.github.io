            <p>Thomas Scott is a resident of the Red River Settlement and a member of the Canadian party (a far-right party that is made up of mainly local ultra-Protestant agitators). We caught him outside the pub to ask him what his thoughts were on the situation surrounding the Metis.
            </p>
            <p><u>What are your thoughts on the situation with the Metis provisional government?</u></p>
            <p>“What have we come to when a bunch of half-breeds are telling us what to do I for one hate it.”
            </p>
            <p><u>How do you think the Federal government should handle the Metis?
            </u></p>
            <p>“We need to educate these Indian half-breeds so they stay inline”
            </p>
            <p><u>What do you think the best course of action for the provisional government should be?
            </u></p>
            <p>“They need to step down and give the government control to the Canadian party”
            </p>
            <p><u>What are your thoughts on the Canadian party?</u></p>
            <p>“I think they are a party that speaks for the pure white men trying to make a living on the Prarie. They are without a doubt better than those dirty Half breeds controlling us.”
